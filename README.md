# Java repeat
It is many small java-projects in one directory. I did this work on the basis of the **[spezialist](https://www.specialist.ru/) java courses levels 1 and 2.**


I repeated java-syntax, collections and sorting, files and streams, threads, databases connection and sql-cueries. I learned a couple of patterns, swing and javaFX. Swing and javaFX are also located in separate repositories: [swing_write_read](https://github.com/Sharibo/swing_write_read), [swing_box](https://github.com/Sharibo/swing_box), [java_fx](https://github.com/Sharibo/java_fx), [java_network](https://github.com/Sharibo/java_network).
